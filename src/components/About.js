      <h1>Hey, my name is Zak</h1>
      <p>
        In late 2020 I decided to take a new career path and for all of 2021
        committed my full time to learning web development. In the past I used
        python for small hobby/fun projects and eventually brought that over
        more into my previous career. Realizing how much I loved learning and
        implementing new technologies I decided to pursue it full time.
